# Result Automation Tool

This project is a result automation tool built using **Node.js**, **Inquirer.js**, and **Taiko**. The tool automates the process of fetching results from the APSBTET result page for a batch of students based on their admission year, branch, and semester.

## Features

- **Automated Result Fetching**: Automatically fills in the pin number and selects the semester on the result page.
- **Batch Processing**: Generates and processes pin numbers for a specified admission year, branch, and batch size.
- **Error Handling**: Handles cases where the result is not available by clearing the input and moving on to the next pin.
- **Headless Browser**: Uses Taiko in headless mode for faster automation and scraping.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** (v12 or higher)
- **Taiko** browser automation framework
- **Inquirer.js** for interactive CLI
